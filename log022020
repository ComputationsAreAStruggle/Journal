Summary: This is my first log. I have no established file format yet. I feel uneasy today. Today felt like a long day. But, I didn't do much. Alright so in the morning I got up, kinda late, at around 9 am I think? Anyways I did Biology homework until my first class (at 11 am). I'm in college but I'm still living at home. This is because my parents dont trust me to make the right decisions, and frankly, I dont trust myself either. I couldnt concentrate on the Biology because I kept on wanting to look through YouTube. I kept on wanting to hear random music. I was also distracted my porn cause I felt so horny. Well, I have a dilemma - my sort-of crush asked me to come study with her - but 1) I dont want a girlfriend this semester and 2) I dont think she likes me. Honestly, Im trying hard just to think about my classes, I think thats all my brain can handle right now. Anyways I'll start this log and stop rambling about.
