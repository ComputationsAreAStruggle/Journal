# Journal * note, the methods listed below work for me and might not work for you. I'm simply exploring my own computational engine (brain).
Unstructured time is wasted time. How to structure time? One possible long-term solution is to keep a public journal.

## usual methods to structure time: 
	 1) group studying (bc we care so much about self image that we dont want to look 
			bad)
	 2) classroom because there's a certain expected behavior
   
in theory, anything could structure time, however, some methods are (much) easier than others.     
Therefore, since the end goal is the same, it doesnt make sense to try harder to accomplish the same thing. 

The problem comes when trying to structure time spent alone
	--> there's no external (3rd) party to provide a "looking glass mirror"....
		so what to do?

This is my attempt at an algorithm to structure my time. Every day, I will make a log of my day. This log will include the following in an organized manner (not necessarily same format as below):
1) accomplishments (and time taken for each in order to calculate efficiency)
2) failures (and how long each lasted)
3) health --> food eaten, exercise done, wake time and sleep time
4) time infront of computer (I have an app that should calculate this for me)

### In theory, this should be very effective without anonyminity. Unfortunately, I do not feel comfortable enough sharing this with my name. Thus, I will try this anonymous approach. This journal shall be and will be completely honest. Even acts I am not proud of will go onto this log...I'll try not to provide too much info - I would like for the world to not know who I am. Maybe...just refer to be as BotLog1 (just made that up now, so if anyone else has that name I'm not associated with them). Hopefully this algorthm will structure my time. Note: this is not a self-help type of act. I simply want to understand myself as a computational system, so that I can purpose my brain effectively. However, in doing so, I suppose I'll be helping myself. If you're reading this, thank you for being a part of this experiment. If you'd like, you can join in - if you do feel free to link your repo/journal/log by making an issue on this repo. Peace out!
