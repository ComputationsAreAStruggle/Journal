Intro: There's still no defined format for these logs. I'm trying to thing of a good format. In the meantime, I'll be posting my daily actions publicly. Today is a day of which I am not too proud. As of writing this (6 12 pm), I have not accomplished very much.
Accomplishments: Bio Exam (not sure if this is an accomplishment, but I'm putting it here for now), 1/4 of Chem homework (very inefficient, listened to music while doing it), talked once in one of my classes (meh, not proud of that), finished computer science lab (semi-efficient), made some bio notes (not efficient at all)
Failures: YouTube 150m (more than 2 hours straight), porn 9m, videogames 2m, Google (random searching) 7m, nothing lost-count, did not each breakfast or lunch, did not exercise, did not wake up on time
Health:
  dinner
  no exercise
  sedentary
  8am-12pm
ComputerTime: 3h 33m, 1 break
PS: I'll update this log as my day finishes.
